# Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, published using GitHub Pages.

The site is a curated index of my work and learning.  
All source code, documentation, and project history live in the linked GitHub repositories.

## Focus
- Python automation and scripting
- AWS fundamentals (IAM, S3, EC2, CloudWatch)
- boto3 for programmatic cloud workflows
- CLI tools, Bash, and Linux-based systems
- Clear structure, repeatable setups, and readable documentation

## Approach
I prioritize automation over manual steps, least-privilege access over convenience, and clarity over cleverness.  
If a process is repeated, it should become a script.
